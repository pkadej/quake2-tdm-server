| TDM Admin Guide |
+-----------------+

TDM comes with it's own unique admin system, this guide will try to guide you through all the available options in
a step-by-step way. First thing that comes to mind is that you can have several different admin files.

On startup TDM looks for a file named 'admin<port>.lst' in the mod's directory (where <port> is the port being used).
For example: if you're running two servers from the same IP but on a different port (lets say 27910 and 27911),
TDM allows you to specify a different admin file for each one by using the files 'admin27910.lst' and 'admin27911.lst'
both with different contents.

Adding new admins to your server is quite easy: you can either do it directly by editting the 'admin<port>.lst' file,
or through use of the server's console. If you prefer the latter, the desired command to use is 'sv addadmin'. The
desired format for this command is:

sv addadmin <groupname> <password> <number of matches> <flags>

First thing you should know is that admins are divided into a so-called group and are unable to use their own name
while adminning, instead they are appointed their group's name. This so-called group can ofcourse also be named after
the person in it if you're only planning on putting 1 person in this group. Another thing you have to take into account
is the number of matches you want this group to be able to admin and set it accordingly (for unlimited use -1). Then
there are the flags, each group can have several flags assigned to it:

   FLAG   | VALUE | SHORTCUT | AVAILABLE COMMANDS
----------+-------+----------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
AD_SERVER |   1   |     s    | kickuser, details, smap, dmf
AD_TEAMS  |   2   |     t    | kickuser, details, readyteam, teamname, teamskin, pickplayer, kickplayer, lockteam, unlockteam
AD_BAN	  |   4   |     b    | kickuser, details, banlist, kickban, unban, ban
AD_MATCH  |   8   |     m    | kickuser, details, start, break, tl, bfg, powerups, time
AD_ALL	  |  16   |     a    | all the above with the addition of adminlist, giveadmin, deladmin

VALUE can be used when directly editting the 'admin<port>.lst' file while SHORTCUT must be used from rcon.

Now for an example: we're going to add a new admin named Bob, Bob is part of a certain group of people wanting match
access because of a cup they're organising. We decide to put Bob into a group named 'Cupadmin' and allow him to admin
an unlimited amount of matches as we don't know how long this cup will last. We issue the following command from console:

'sv addadmin Cupadmin mysecretpassword -1 m'

Bob can now login as an admin by typing 'admin mysecretpassword' in his console after connecting to the server.

If you're wanting to edit the admin file by hand, the used format is exactly the same except for the use of
VALUE instead of SHORTCUT. The above example would become: 'Cupadmin mysecretpassword -1 8' in 'admin<port>.lst'.
Also note that the FLAGS can be added together like DMFLAGS, if you want a group to be able to use both AD_SERVER and
AD_BAN you would issue a 'sv addadmin Cupadmin mysecretpassword -1 sb' command or insert 'Cupadmin mysecretpassword -1 5'
into 'admin<port>.lst' (AD_SERVER = 1, AD_BAN = 4, 1 + 4 = 5).

Before finishing up you might want to note that if you grant a specific group AD_ALL access, they gain the 'giveadmin'
command. This command is similar to the 'sv addadmin' command with the difference that it can be used in-game! This means
people in this group can add new admin groups to your server after they login as an admin without having rcon access.
